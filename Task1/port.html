        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there, I'm Priyanka Garg and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I am passionate about using technology to bring about positive change in the world. My curiosity about how technology works and shapes our lives has driven me to develop my skills in programming, data structures, algorithms, and software development. I always strive to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and emerging technologies in the industry.
<br>
Collaboration and teamwork are essential values for me. I have participated in various group projects, both in and out of the classroom, which taught me the importance of effective communication and collective problem-solving. I have honed my interpersonal skills and enhanced my technical abilities through these experiences.
<br>
Apart from academics, I enjoy participating in coding competitions, hackathons, and open-source projects. These opportunities have allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, fostering creativity and innovative thinking.
<br>
I believe that learning is a lifelong process, and I am always seeking new opportunities to expand my horizons. As I progress through my BTech CSE program, I aspire to delve deeper into areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, and software engineering. My ultimate goal is to leverage my education and skills to contribute to cutting-edge technological advancements that can address global challenges and improve the lives of individuals and communities.</p>
